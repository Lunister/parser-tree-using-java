# parser-tree-using-java

In this code, I implemented a parser tree using java

a parse tree or syntax tree refers to a tree-like structure that represents the hierarchical relationship and organization of data elements or expressions based on a specific grammar or syntax.

For example, in the context of representing arithmetic expressions, a syntax tree can be used to show how the operators and operands are arranged. Each node in the syntax tree represents an operator or an operand, and the edges represent the relationships between these elements. The tree is constructed according to the rules of the expression's grammar.

Let's take an example of a simple arithmetic expression: "3 + 4 * 5".

The corresponding syntax tree for this expression would look like:

    +
   / \
  3   *
     / \
    4   5

Here, the syntax tree shows that the expression is an addition operation (+) at the top level, and its operands are 3 and the result of another operation represented by the '*' (multiplication) operator. The multiplication operation, in turn, has operands 4 and 5

This program implements a tree using this functionality and converts a string expression into a parse or syntax tree and vice versa
